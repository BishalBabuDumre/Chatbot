# Chatbot
Due to frustration of the chatbots encountered while getting customer service in various enterprises, I am developing a conversational chatbot as a personal project using machine learning approaches, viz. TfidfVectorizer of sklearn and numpy. This project is built for an arbitrary business.
I have built the prototype and now I am focusing on the algorithm of the Vectorizer.
To see my prototype, open the following link:

Type whatever you want to ask. If you type "opening hours", it will give you some answer. You can see the question answer I trained by looking at file bot_trainer.py.
