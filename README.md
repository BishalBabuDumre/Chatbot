# Chatbot
Due to frustration of the chatbots encountered while getting customer service in various enterprises, I am developing a conversational chatbot as a personal project using machine learning approaches, viz. TfidfVectorizer of sklearn and numpy. This project is built for an arbitrary business.
I have built the prototype and now I am focusing on the algorithm of the Vectorizer.
To see my prototype, open Terminal in macOS or Linux and follow the following commands in succession:

Step 1: git clone https://github.com/BishalBabuDumre/Chatbot
Step 2: cd Chatbot
Step 3: python bot_trainer.py
Step 4: python web_app.py
Step 5: open http://0.0.0.0:8000 in your browser
Step 6: type whatever you want to ask. If you type "opening hours", it will give you some answer. You can see the question answer I trained by looking at file bot_trainer.py.
