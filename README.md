# Chatbot
Due to frustration of the chatbots encountered while getting customer service in various enterprises, I am developing a conversational chatbot as a personal project using machine learning approaches, viz. TfidfVectorizer of sklearn and numpy. This project is built for an arbitrary business.
I have built the prototype and now I am focusing on the algorithm of the Vectorizer.
To see my prototype, open the following link:

You need to enter your information, and then you will be able to use the chatbot in the next webpage. I have collected this information in an AWS RDS for Postgres database thereby learning SQL.
After you finish providing the information, type whatever you want to ask. If you type "opening hours", it will give you some answer. You can see the question answer I trained by looking at file bot_trainer.py.
